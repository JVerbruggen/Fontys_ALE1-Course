This project is about propositions and operators. This code is able to:
- Parse ASCII format propositions (such as `>(&(A,|(B,C))~(D))`) into a proposition object in memory
- Generate truthtables from propositions
- Convert proposition into Conjunctive Normal Form and Disjunctive Normal Form
- Stringify the proposition into ASCII format and infix format (logic notation)
- Export propositions into a GraphViz visualization
- Generate a unique hash of the proposition, made possible by the truthtables
